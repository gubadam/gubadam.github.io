## Ingredients

### Cabbage prep
- 1 head of Napa cabbage
- 1/4 cup of table salt
- 1 cup of water

### Kimchi paste
- 3/4 cup of water
- 1 tablespoon of grated ginger
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 3-6 tablespoons of gochugaru (red chili pepper flakes, adjust to taste)
- 2 carrots, thinly sliced
- 4 tablespoon of soy sauce

## Recipe
1. Prepare the cabbage:
  - Cut the Napa cabbage into pieces.
  - Dissolve the table salt in a cup of water and pour it over the cabbage.
  - Let it sit for 1-2 hours to soften and release its juices.
2. Prepare the Marinade:
  - Mix water, soy sauce, grated ginger, minced garlic, sugar, and gochugaru in a bowl.
3. Combine the Ingredients:
  - Add the cabbage to the marinade, and then add the carrots. Mix everything thoroughly.
4. Fermentation:
  - Transfer the mixture to a jar, pressing down the ingredients.
  - Ensure the cabbage doesn't protrude above the liquid to avoid molding. If it does, top the jar with some of the salty water from the 1st step.
  - Cover the jars with lids, but do not tighten them, so the gasses can escape during the first fermentation.
  - After 3-5 days, tighten the jars and put them in the fridge.
  - Kimchi is ready to eat, but it gets better with time. I suggest waiting at least 2-3 weeks, preferably a month.
